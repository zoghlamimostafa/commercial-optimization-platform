## üìà Export Content Details

### Excel Files Include:
- **Professional formatting** with headers, colors, borders

- Rate limiting through Flask session management

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance and Updates

### Adding New Export Types
1. Create export function in `export_utilities.py`
2. Add route in `app.py`
3. Add button/UI element in relevant template
4. Update this documentation

### Modifying Export Content
1. Update database queries in utility functions
2. Test with sample data
3. Verify Excel formatting and CSV structure
4. Update user documentation

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor export times for large datasets
- Watch memory usage during Excel generation
- Check disk space in exports directory
- Monitor user feedback for improvements

## üéâ Benefits for Users

### Business Users

4. **CSV encoding issues**: Ensure UTF-8 support in viewing application

### Getting Help
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify Flask application logs for server-side issues
- Test with smaller datasets to isolate problems
- Contact system administrator for database-related issues
